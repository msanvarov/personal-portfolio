        <h3>Hopin Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          <b>
            Hopin is one of the leading platforms that offers tailored
            transportation for daily commutes. Through logistics software, Hopin
            uses existing charter and rideshare fleets. Their software enables
            calculation of the route distance and compares every pricing option
            to offer the best one. The process is as simple as registering and
            choosing from a pick up location. Hopin handles everything else.
            They provide the shuttle location and a pick-up window. Hopin has
            been featured on the Brampton Board of Trade, Founders Beta - 20
            Tech Companies to Watch for in 2021 and many more publications.
            They’re currently in partnership with Durham Region, JLL, Markham,
            Vaughan and expanding regionally.

        <h3>Contribution</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a client facing mobile application using React Native to
          offer transportation logistics to company employees. Reduced hundreds
          of labour-hours in collecting and recording routes manually through
          google forms. Built with Typescript and Expo for easier developer
          experience and code maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employed GCP's Firebase and Samsara ecosystems to rapidly develop and
          prototype a functioning backend for performing and storing
          transportation related operations. Moving from a manual approach to a
          automated process to enable ease of use and extensibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed a company website to advertise the application and their
          offerings, with a modern stack of React and Gatsby. A more appealing
          landing page will aid in conveying their business message more
          effectively to potential clients.
