            Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 8 years
            ago, I&lsquo;ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for
            startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital
            products for both business and consumer use. I&lsquo;m quietly
            confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving
            my chopsone design problem at a time.
